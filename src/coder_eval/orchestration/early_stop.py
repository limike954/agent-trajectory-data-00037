"""Early-stop-on-criterion: resolution-time validation + runtime watcher.

Opt-in mechanism (``run_limits.stop_early``) that ends a single-shot run as soon
as its *armed* criteria (those with ``stop_when`` set) are decided mid-run — on
pass or on a definitive fail. This module owns the whole feature:

* ``validate_early_stop`` — resolution-time guardrails. Rejects every
  configuration v1 cannot honor as a hard error, so an unsupported arming is
  never a silent no-op.
* ``EarlyStopWatcher`` — the runtime observer. A ``StreamCallback`` composed
  into the agent's event stream that maintains its own ``EventCollector``,
  evaluates every armed criterion's ``live_verdict`` on each tool completion,
  applies the stop rule, and exposes ``should_stop()`` (the cooperative
  interrupt the agent polls) plus ``info`` (the ``EarlyStopInfo`` the
  orchestrator records). Fail-open: a raising ``live_verdict`` disarms the
  watcher and degrades to a full run — a verdict bug can never cause a *false*
  early stop.

Live verdicts only *trigger* the stop; the authoritative scores always come
from the standard ``check_all`` on the frozen trajectory after the cut.
