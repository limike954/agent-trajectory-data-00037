"""LLM-driven user simulator for multi-turn dialog evaluation.

The simulator runs as a **tools-disabled Claude Code agent** — same backend
route as the coding agent, but with no Bash/Write/Read/Skill/MCP access, no
plugins, and no settings sources. It is pure text-in, text-out: every
response is treated as the next utterance the simulated user would say to
the coding agent.

This unifies backend selection (``-b bedrock`` / ``-b direct``
all work without parallel invoker code) and piggybacks on the SDK's native
session resume for multi-turn conversation history — the simulator LLM sees
its own past utterances as assistant messages and the coding agent's replies
as user messages automatically.

Security note: persona, goal, and constraints go into the simulator's system
prompt. The task's reference solution is NEVER passed to the simulator —
just as it is never passed to the coding agent.

- You CANNOT see the agent's files, terminal, or internal reasoning — only what it writes in the chat.
- When you judge the task to be complete, emit the exact token `{config.stop_token}` anywhere in your message.
  That token ends the conversation. Do not emit it prematurely, and do not emit it repeatedly.
- Do not apologize, do not praise the agent, do not narrate your own thought process.
