"""Sibling-file persistence for ``JudgeCriterionResult.transcript``.

The full judge transcript (tool calls, raw verdict, rendered prompt and
system prompt) can run 10-100 KB. Inlining it into every ``task.json``
inflates the row record for consumers (suite rollups, report renderers)
that don't need it. Spilling each transcript to a sibling
``judge-<idx>.yaml`` next to ``task.json`` keeps the row record lean and
lets reviewers grep transcripts independently.

YAML (over JSON) for the sibling: the transcript carries multi-line text
(``judge_prompt``, ``judge_system_prompt``, ``raw_verdict``) which YAML's
literal block scalar (``|``) renders as readable paragraphs instead of
single-line strings with ``\\n`` escapes. Sibling consumers are humans;
YAML wins.

Two functions:

- ``spill_judge_transcripts``: called by the orchestrator just before it
  writes ``task.json``. For each judge result with an inline ``transcript``,
  writes a sibling file and sets ``transcript_path`` on the result. The
  inline ``transcript`` is left in place so HTML rendering against the
  in-memory ``EvaluationResult`` still sees it; ``model_dump_json``
  callers strip it via ``exclude={...}``.

- ``load_judge_transcripts``: called by re-render paths
  (``coder-eval report``, stats loaders) after
  ``EvaluationResult.model_validate_json``. For each result whose
  ``transcript_path`` points at an existing sibling file, reads it back
  and attaches it as a dict on ``transcript`` so renderers see the same
  shape they get during the original run. Accepts both ``.yaml`` (the
  current format) and ``.json`` (the previous format) so previously-spilled
  runs keep rendering.

Backward compatibility: old ``task.json`` files with inline ``transcript``
keep working — the loader treats ``transcript_path is None`` as a no-op.
