"""Typed verdict tool channel — replaces text-with-JSON parsing for judge criteria.

Defines a single ``submit_verdict`` tool the judge calls as its terminal action,
exposed in two native shapes (SDK MCP, Anthropic) so each judge backend can use
its own tool-calling protocol. The extractors then collapse those native
responses into a single ``tuple[JudgeVerdict | None, str | None]`` contract so
the rest of the criterion code doesn't branch on backend.

The shared anchor is ``JudgeVerdict.model_validate(args_dict)``: every backend
ultimately delivers a ``dict``-shaped tool input, and that one call decides
validity. Error vocabulary is preserved via ``_format_validation_error`` so
existing tests / on-disk records keep matching.
