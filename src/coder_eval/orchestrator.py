        [RESULT - SUCCESS] Here is the answer...

    The SDK's ``ResultMessage`` duplicates the final assistant text, which

    ``[RESULT - ...]`` payload when it is non-empty (it is the canonical
    final utterance); otherwise fall back to concatenated ``[ASSISTANT]``
    blocks. ``[TOOL USE]`` lines are dropped. Input that does not look
    tagged at all (plain user text like a pinned initial_prompt) is
    returned unchanged.

    Pre-tag content handling: any content appearing BEFORE the first
    tagged line is collected into an implicit ``[ASSISTANT]`` block. It
    survives in the output only on the ASSISTANT-fallback path (no
    ``[RESULT - ...]`` in the transcript). When a ``[RESULT - SUCCESS]``
    is present, it supersedes all ``[ASSISTANT]`` content — including
    any pre-tag content — because the ResultMessage is the SDK's
    canonical final utterance and ASSISTANT lines are chain-of-thought
    that the RESULT already incorporates. ClaudeCodeAgent always begins
    its output with a tag in practice, so this mostly matters for
    defensive handling of upstream format drift.

    Asymmetry note: ``[RESULT - SUCCESS]`` strips its label (it is the
    canonical answer); ``[RESULT - ERROR]`` keeps a ``[RESULT - ERROR]``
    prefix in the output so the error state remains visible in the log.

        That means three pre-existing gaps remain (none introduced by this

        - **Agent crash / turn timeout** — the sync is skipped because the
          method never returns; criteria fall back to ambient
          ``os.environ['PATH']``. Acceptable: a crashed agent's SDK PATH may
          itself be unreliable.
        - **Evaluate-only mode** (``orchestrator.run_evaluation_only``) — no
          agent turn runs, so no sync. Criteria use ambient PATH, same as
          before this change.
        - **Before the first turn** — same reason; first criterion check
          always runs after at least one turn under the normal flow.

        Sandbox-setup-time sync (using ``SandboxConfig.mock_path_dirs``) was
        considered but rejected: the agent SDK's effective PATH is only
        knowable after the SDK initializes, so a setup-time sync would
        capture only the configured prepends, not the full agent env.

        ``Agent.get_sdk_options()`` is declared synchronous on the ABC
        (``dict[str, Any] | None``). ``AsyncMock``-based test fixtures
        return a coroutine for *any* attribute access regardless of the
        declared signature; ``isawaitable`` plus ``coroutine.close()``

        from those fixtures into unrelated tests. That is a test-fixture
