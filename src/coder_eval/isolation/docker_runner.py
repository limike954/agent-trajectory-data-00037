# everything else under ~/.claude is heavy, transient, or host-local state it

# this is the difference between a ~300 MB copy and a few MB: `security/` (the

# the container. The last group is volatile per-session churn the *running* CLI
# rewrites continuously (this harness itself runs inside Claude Code, so the live
# host ~/.claude is mutating while we copy): dropping it both keeps the copy lean
