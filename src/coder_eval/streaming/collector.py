"""EventCollector: reduce a standardized event stream into a TurnRecord.

This is the single, agent-agnostic place where the persisted ``TurnRecord``
(and therefore ``task.json``) is assembled from the event stream — so adding a
new agent means emitting the standard events, with capture coming for free
(no per-agent telemetry-assembly code).

Reduction split:

- ``commands`` are derived from the ``ToolEndEvent`` stream (every tool call,
  including crash-orphaned ones force-closed as ``unresolved``), ordered by the
  tool's ``sequence_number``. This is the genuine "events are the source of
  truth" path for tool telemetry.
- The per-message telemetry / token payload (the intricate, SDK-specific token
  machinery the plan defers) rides on the terminal ``AgentEndEvent`` and is read
  back verbatim — no re-derivation, so token correctness is untouched.

An agent attaches its own ``EventCollector`` alongside the caller's callback and
returns ``build_turn_record()`` from ``communicate()``; the orchestrator keeps
reading the return value (and ``pending_turn`` on crash), now event-derived.
