# Approval mode — the SAME for every permission mode (no per-mode mapping).
#
# The Codex SDK exposes exactly two approval modes:
#   - auto_review → AskForApproval.on_request + a SERVER-SIDE ApprovalsReviewer.
#     The reviewer (an extra app-server/gateway decision) adjudicates each
#     apply_patch/shell escalation. Under gateway load it can spuriously return
#     "declined" — files silently not written. Claude has no analog: its
#     Write/Edit permissions are decided CLIENT-SIDE with no model/reviewer in
#     the loop, so it never hits this failure mode.
#   - deny_all → AskForApproval.never + NO reviewer. Despite the name, this is
#     the "run autonomously, never prompt, no reviewer" mode: in-sandbox
#     operations (apply_patch within cwd, shell) execute directly; only
#     escalations BEYOND the sandbox are refused.
#
# An eval harness never wants a reviewer that can flake, so EVERY permission mode
# uses deny_all. The trust boundary is the sandbox (_PERMISSION_MODE_TO_SANDBOX),
# which DOES vary by mode: `plan` stays read-only, `bypassPermissions` is
# full-access (intended for isolated Docker runs).

# silently recorded as a successful Write. We use this only to classify the
# Write TELEMETRY honestly (failed → error). We do NOT fail or retry the turn on
# it: "declined" can only come from an approval reviewer, and every permission
# mode uses deny_all (no reviewer; see _CODEX_APPROVAL_MODE), so
# in-sandbox apply_patch is applied directly and "declined" should not occur;
# "failed" (diff context mismatch) is self-healed by the model within the turn,

           spawned model. Follow-up ``wait``/messaging calls reuse the same thread
           and are NOT new sub-agents.

           Codex emits NO per-sub-agent token breakdown in the parent stream —
           every ``thread/tokenUsage/updated`` reports only the PARENT thread's
           cumulative usage. The child's real per-generation tokens are recovered

           ``parent_tool_use_id`` messages (see ``_recover_subagent_tool_calls``);
           ``_finalize`` then folds those messages into the turn total.

        2. RESULT: any collab completion may carry the child's returned message in
           ``agents_states[thread].message``. We stash it in ``collab_results`` as
           a FALLBACK — used only if the child's rollout can't be found later. When
           the rollout IS found, ``_recover_subagent_tool_calls`` rebuilds the
           sub-agent's full generation sequence (tool calls + final text) with real
           per-generation tokens, so the returned message is just the last of those.

        Codex runs every sub-agent on its own child thread whose events never

        rollout policy — which drops ``commandExecution`` events. So neither the
        live stream nor ``thread.read`` surfaces the sub-agent's shell commands,
        and ``thread/tokenUsage/updated`` only ever reports the PARENT thread, so
        per-child tokens never appear in the live stream.

        But the child rollout ALWAYS persists the raw ``function_call`` /
        ``local_shell_call`` / ``custom_tool_call`` (+ ``*_output``) ResponseItems
        (``should_persist_response_item`` keeps them regardless of mode) AND a

          includes the sub-agent, exactly as Claude's total already includes its
