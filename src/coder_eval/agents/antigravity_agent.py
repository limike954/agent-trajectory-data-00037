"""Antigravity agent implementation using the official google-antigravity SDK.

The backend drives Google's Antigravity agent *local harness* (the bundled
``localharness`` binary shipped in the ``google-antigravity`` wheel) via the
SDK's :class:`LocalAgentConfig`. It authenticates against the Gemini Developer
API with ``GEMINI_API_KEY`` and runs entirely on the local machine, editing
files inside the sandbox working directory — so coder_eval's on-disk success
criteria see the agent's writes exactly as they do for Claude / Codex.

Why this surface (and not the branded ``agy`` CLI or the remote SDK): the
standalone Antigravity CLI cannot authenticate headlessly with a Gemini API key
(only interactive OAuth), and the Interactions API runs in a *remote* cloud
sandbox whose edits never land in our local dir. The local harness is the only
non-deprecated path that satisfies headless + GEMINI_API_KEY + local execution.

All SDK imports are lazy (inside ``start`` / helpers), mirroring CodexAgent, so
this module imports cleanly when the optional ``[antigravity]`` extra is absent;
a missing SDK surfaces as a clear install hint at ``start()``.
