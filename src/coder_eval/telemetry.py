"""User telemetry via OpenTelemetry → Azure Application Insights ``customEvents``.

A self-contained, opt-out usage-telemetry side-channel. It emits discrete
lifecycle events (run-start, task-end, per-command) to the App Insights
``customEvents`` table and is **never** part of the eval data path.

How customEvents routing works
------------------------------
The Azure Monitor exporter routes an OpenTelemetry *log record* to the
``customEvents`` table (instead of the default ``traces`` table) **iff** the
record carries the attribute ``microsoft.custom_event.name``. The event name is
that attribute's value; every other record attribute becomes a
``customDimensions`` entry. We reach that attribute through plain stdlib
logging: an OTel ``LoggingHandler`` is attached to a dedicated logger, and
``track_event`` calls ``logger.info(name, extra={...})``. So the only OTel/Azure
imports live inside ``init_telemetry`` — ``track_event`` is pure stdlib and a
cheap no-op when telemetry is off.

Posture
-------
Telemetry is **on by default**: an ingestion-only Application Insights connection
string is baked into the app (``config._DEFAULT_TELEMETRY_CONNECTION_STRING``) so a
fresh install reports usage to the shared coder-eval resource. An explicitly-set
``APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING`` / ``UIPATH_AI_CONNECTION_STRING`` /
``TELEMETRY_CONNECTION_STRING`` (env or ``.env``) takes precedence, routing
telemetry elsewhere. Telemetry is **off** only when ``TELEMETRY_ENABLED`` is set
false (the single canonical disable gate) or the connection string is cleared.
No prompts, file contents, or repo paths are ever captured — only enums, counts,
durations, an anonymous per-install id (a random UUID persisted in the user
config file — identifies an install, not a person), and non-PII platform
identity (OS / arch / Python version). Because telemetry is default-on, the first
run that initializes it prints a one-time stderr notice disclosing what is
collected and how to disable it (``_maybe_show_first_run_notice``).

Non-fatal contract
-------------------
Every public function wraps its body in ``try/except Exception`` and logs a
warning rather than raising — telemetry must never break a run. This invariant
is enforced by the CE019 custom lint rule. Persisting the anonymous install id
is best-effort too: if its config file can't be written, telemetry still emits
events, just without the ``InstallId`` dimension.
