"""Analysis tools for evaluation results.

This module provides utilities for analyzing and aggregating evaluation data,
particularly command telemetry statistics.

Separation of Concerns:
- Orchestrator: Coordinates evaluation execution
- Analysis: Processes results into insights
- Reports: Formats insights for human consumption
