        On success, ``pending_turn`` must be None and the completed TurnRecord

        and exactly one matching ``AgentEndEvent`` on every exit path (success,
        crash, or timeout — emit it from ``finally``), with one ``TurnStartEvent``
        / ``TurnEndEvent`` pair per inner turn and ``ToolStartEvent`` /
        ``ToolEndEvent`` for each tool call (every ``ToolStart`` closed by a
        ``ToolEnd``, including ``status=unresolved`` for tools orphaned by a crash).
        Events fan out through an internal ``EventCollector`` (which builds the
        returned ``TurnRecord``) and the caller's ``stream_callback``; renderers
