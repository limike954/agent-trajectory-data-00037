    """Match a single label written by the agent to a file against ground truth.

    Reads the file, normalizes the content (strip + optional lowercase), and
    compares it to ``expected_label``. The observed label is the canonical form
    from ``allowed_labels`` when it matches; otherwise ``'(none)'`` when the
    file is missing / empty and ``'(other)'`` when the content is not in the
    allowed set. Both are recorded as sentinels so the suite rollup can show
    them as real failure classes in the confusion matrix.

    The checker returns a ``ClassificationCriterionResult`` (subclass of
    ``CriterionResult``) carrying observed + expected labels, which the
    suite aggregator reads to compute P/R/F1 per class and a confusion matrix.

    """Spawn a Claude Code SDK agent as the judge.

    The judge runs in an isolated copy of the sandbox with tool access (Bash, Read,
    Glob, Grep by default) and reports its verdict by calling the in-process
    ``submit_verdict`` MCP tool (``mcp__coder_eval_judge__submit_verdict``,
    force-added to ``allowed_tools``) exactly once with ``score`` / ``rationale``
    / ``findings``. The SDK has no ``tool_choice`` equivalent so the channel
    relies on system-prompt discipline; a judge that never calls the tool
    scores 0.0 with a "did not call submit_verdict" diagnostic.

    File access: the judge has live access to the sandbox copy as its working
    directory and can load files via its tools (``Read``, ``Glob``). The optional
    ``files`` field pre-attaches selected file contents to the prompt envelope —
    useful when you want a fast verdict (single turn, no tool calls) or want to
    grade with the narrowest tool surface (``allowed_tools=[]``). Pre-attach and
    tool-driven inspection compose: the judge sees the pre-attached blocks and
    can still ``Read`` anything else.

    SECURITY: The judge runs with the evaluator's API credentials and can execute
    arbitrary Bash by default. Four attack surfaces:
      1. Malicious generation artifacts the judge executes (e.g. via `python x.py`).
      2. Prompt injection from included agent_output / tool-call summaries.
      3. Credential exfiltration via any network-capable tool (primarily Bash).
      4. Hooks / MCP servers planted by the main agent (e.g. `.claude/settings.json`
         or `.mcp.json` dropped into the sandbox) that would run before any LLM turn
         and before allowed_tools gating. The judge sets ``setting_sources=[]`` and
         excludes both paths from the sandbox copy, so neither gets loaded.
    Use ``llm_judge`` for scenarios with adversarial generation. Narrow
    ``allowed_tools`` per task when Bash is not needed.

    Continuous scoring. Verdict-validation errors or a "did not call" diagnostic
