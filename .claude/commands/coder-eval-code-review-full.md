description: Review the codebase across critical quality axes
---

## Context

You are performing a structured codebase review of the `coder_eval` project.

Optional argument: $ARGUMENTS — space-separated tokens that control review
scope and axis selection. See **Scope Selection** below. If empty, review the
full codebase across all 8 axes.

## Scope Selection

`$ARGUMENTS` accepts a space-separated set of tokens. Default scope is `all`.
Default axes are all 8.

**Scope tokens** (pick one):

- `all` — full codebase (walk `src/coder_eval/`). Default.
- `local` — uncommitted changes + untracked files. Resolve via `git status --porcelain` plus `git diff` for tracked changes; read untracked files directly.
- `staged` — only files in `git diff --staged --name-only`.
- `branch` — files changed on the current branch vs `main` (`git diff main...HEAD --name-only`).
- `unpushed` — commits on the current branch not on `origin` (`git log @{u}..HEAD --name-only --pretty=format: | sort -u`).
- `pr:<N>` — files in GitHub PR #N **at the PR's actual HEAD, not the local working tree**. The local checkout may differ from (or be unaware of) the PR's branch. Resolve as follows:
  1. `git fetch origin pull/<N>/head:pr-<N>` — creates a local ref `pr-<N>` at the PR's HEAD (works for fork PRs too via the GitHub `pull/<N>/head` refspec).
  2. `gh pr view <N> --json baseRefName -q .baseRefName` → store as `<base>`.
  3. `git fetch origin <base>:refs/remotes/origin/<base>` — ensure base is current.
  4. File list: `git diff origin/<base>...pr-<N> --name-only`.
  5. **Sub-agents read file contents via `git show pr-<N>:<path>`, NOT via Read on the working tree.** Include this instruction in every sub-agent prompt for `pr:<N>` scope.

**Axis filter** (optional, combinable with any scope):

- `axis:<comma-list>` — restrict to the listed axis numbers (e.g. `axis:4,6`).

**Action flags** (optional, combinable with any scope):

- `--post-comment` — after writing the report, post `99-pr-comment.md` to the relevant PR via `gh pr review <N> --comment --body-file <path>`. Treat this token as explicit authorization to perform the shared-state action; do not re-confirm with the user. The PR number is resolved as follows:
  1. If scope is `pr:<N>`, use that N directly.
  2. Otherwise (`branch` / `local` / `staged` / `unpushed` / `all`), interpret the flag as "post to *this* PR" — the PR associated with the current branch. Resolve via `gh pr view --json number,title,author,headRefName,baseRefName,state` (no arg = current branch). If that succeeds and the PR is `OPEN`, use its number. If `gh pr view` fails (no PR for the branch) or the PR is closed/merged, abort before running any tools with a clear error: "--post-comment requires either `pr:<N>` scope or an open PR for the current branch; got `<branch>` with no open PR" — and suggest pushing the branch + opening a PR first, or invoking with `pr:<N>` explicitly.

  When this resolves successfully for a non-`pr:<N>` scope, also stash the PR metadata (title/author/headRef/baseRef) for the PR-comment file header — same as the `pr:<N>` path — so the comment is framed as a PR review regardless of which scope drove it.

**Examples**:

- `pr:253` — review PR #253 across all 8 axes (writes the PR comment as a file; does not post).
- `pr:253 --post-comment` — review PR #253 and post the comment to GitHub.
- `branch --post-comment` — review the current branch's diff vs `main` and post to *this* branch's PR.
- `local --post-comment` — review uncommitted + untracked changes and post to this branch's PR.
- `branch axis:4` — security-only review of current branch's changes vs `main`.
- `local` — review everything uncommitted and untracked.
- (empty) — full review of the whole codebase, all axes.

**Two rules for non-`all` scopes**:

1. **Read freely beyond the diff; file findings only inside it.** Reviewing a
   change in `orchestrator.py` requires reading its callers, the types it
   touches, and the tests for it. Sub-agents treat the scoped file list as
   the *target for findings* — they may read any file in the repo for
   context, but a finding MUST be against a file in scope. This catches bugs
   that only become visible when you read the surrounding code.

2. **Some axes don't scope cleanly — adjust the question they answer.**
   Architecture (Axis 5) and Harness Quality (Axis 8) are whole-system
   properties. For non-`all` scopes, those axes answer "does this change
   make the architecture / harness *worse*?" — not "is the architecture good
   in absolute terms." File a finding only if an in-scope change introduces
   or worsens an axis-5/8 issue.

## Review Principles

All analysis must evaluate against the core principles defined in
`.claude/shared/review-rubric.md` → **"Review Principles"** (bug-free code, KISS,
DRY without over-applying it, not over-engineered, simplicity, no unnecessary
comments, CLAUDE.md adherence). Read that section; do not work from memory. The
per-axis **Severity Standard** below is specific to this command and is defined
locally — it is NOT governed by the shared rubric.

## Severity Standard

Every finding MUST be tagged 🔴 Critical / 🟠 High / 🟡 Medium / 🔵 Low. Calibrate
by **impact if shipped**, not by fix difficulty. When torn between two levels,
pick the lower one. The anchors below define each axis's bar — match a finding
to the closest example before assigning.

### Per-axis severity anchors

| Axis | 🔴 Critical | 🟠 High | 🟡 Medium | 🔵 Low |
|------|------------|--------|----------|-------|
| **1. Code Quality** | Dead code on a live path that misleads readers into wrong assumptions (e.g. an unused branch in the orchestrator that looks load-bearing) | Cyclomatic complexity > 20 in a hot module (`orchestrator`, `checker`, `sandbox`); duplicated logic across 4+ sites; machinery disproportionate to the goal — a new enum/flag/alias layer for behavior derivable from existing state, or a user-facing knob that creates a second source of truth to keep in sync | CC 10–20 outside hot modules; duplication across 2–3 sites; hardcoded magic-string special-cases where a generic mechanism fits; an abstraction introduced for a single call site | Naming inconsistency; long function that's still readable; missing internal docstring |
| **2. Type Safety** | Type hole that lets malformed task YAML pass `TaskDefinition` validation silently | `Any` in a public API consumed by agents/criteria; missing types on a user-facing Pydantic field | Missing return types on internal helpers in hot modules; `# type: ignore` without justification | Missing types on private helpers in cold paths |
| **3. Test Health** | No coverage for orchestrator main loop, sandbox cleanup, or a `FinalStatus` failure path | Untested public API (`run_batch`, a `BaseCriterion` subclass); flaky test masking a real race | Coverage gap on a non-critical module; missing edge cases on one criterion | Test that duplicates another; minor readability issue in a test |
| **4. Security** (CVSS v3.1) | CVSS 9.0–10.0 — shell-quoted user input passed to `subprocess` with `shell=True` in the sandbox path; secrets written to a world-readable log; auth token forwarded to an attacker-controlled URL | CVSS 7.0–8.9 — path traversal in template loading reachable only with a crafted task YAML; `pip-audit` finding with a known exploit in a runtime dependency | CVSS 4.0–6.9 — bandit B603 on a subprocess call whose arguments come from internal config but aren't shell-escaped; outdated dep with a vulnerability not reachable from our call sites | CVSS 0.1–3.9 — missing `# nosec` justification on an audited call; hardcoded localhost URL that should be configurable |
| **5. Architecture** | Coupling that breaks an extension point claimed in CLAUDE.md (e.g. orchestrator hardcodes Claude Code assumptions, blocking new `Agent` subclasses) | God class > 500 lines mixing 3+ concerns in a hot module; circular import worked around with local `import` | DRY violation across `criteria/` or `models/`; pattern drift between similar checkers | Module that could be split for cohesion but isn't painful today |
| **6. Error Handling** | Resource leak that compounds across runs (subprocess, tempdir, file handle); failure path that returns a successful `EvaluationResult` with wrong data | Bare `except:` or `except Exception:` swallowing a specific error class; missing cleanup on a rare-but-reachable path; retry that double-counts tokens/cost | Inconsistent error context (some paths wrap, some don't); error categorization gap in `errors/categories.py` | Error message could name the offending field |
| **7. API Surface** | Silently-wrong CLI default (e.g. `--max-turns` ignored when also set in YAML) producing incorrect evaluation results | Breaking change to a documented CLI flag without alias; required flag with no sensible default and no clear error when omitted | Too many overlapping knobs for one feature; flag name doesn't match its YAML key | Help text could be clearer; example in `--help` is stale |
| **8. Harness Quality** | Non-determinism in scoring: same task + same agent output produces different `score` across runs | Criterion with ambiguous pass/fail (judge prompt drift; threshold semantics unclear); `Agent` ABC assumption that ties orchestrator to Claude Code | Awkward YAML schema for a common case; unhelpful error when task definition is malformed; reports lack a field needed for cross-run comparison | Convenience missing (e.g. no `--dry-run`); minor UX paper cut |

**Axis 4 (Security) additional requirement**: every security finding MUST
include the CVSS v3.1 vector string (e.g.
`CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H`) so the severity rating is
reproducible. The base score determined by that vector must match the column
the finding is filed under.

**Axis 8 (Harness) scoring-correctness rule**: treat as 🔴/🟠 *any* change
that can alter a task's `score` or `final_status` for **identical agent
output** — this is the team's true blocker class, broader than the "run-to-run
non-determinism" anchor in the table. It includes, but is not limited to:
stale artifacts surviving a resumed or re-run task (a reused sandbox/output
dir that isn't cleared, so a prior run's files leak into the new score); a
status classifier that mis-buckets a value (a `FinalStatus` mislabeled as
success vs. failure, or rows silently dropped from a metric's numerator or
denominator by an over-broad early-`continue`/filter); a nondeterministic
headline metric (unseeded sampling, dict/set iteration order, or wall-clock
leaking into a score); and a persisted result record (`task.json`) that
silently mis-loads or mis-parses under a schema or computed-field change. When
unsure whether such a change is a blocker or a nit, it is a blocker.

**Severity is NOT**:
- a measure of fix difficulty (a one-line fix can still be 🔴)
- a vote of confidence — use the `Cross-axis: flagged by axes <list>` note for that
- comparable across axes (a 🟠 in Test Health and a 🟠 in Architecture are both High, not "equally bad")

When sub-agents disagree on severity for the same finding, synthesis takes the
**highest** rating and records the disagreement in the finding's notes.

## Scoring

Each axis gets a numeric score 0–10, derived **deterministically** from its
finding counts. Same findings → same score, every run. There is no
"give it a feel" component.

**Per-axis formula**:

```
score = max(0, 10 − 3.0·🔴 − 1.0·🟠 − 0.5·🟡 − 0.1·🔵)
```

Round to one decimal place.

**Weight rationale** (so future edits don't unwittingly recalibrate):
- One 🔴 alone → 7.0. A single critical is a serious dent; three 🔴 (→ 1.0) all but tanks the axis.
- Two 🔴 → 4.0; four 🔴 → 0. Criticals dominate fast.
- One 🟠 → 9.0; ten 🟠 → 0. Sustained High noise tanks the axis on its own.
- 10 🟡 → 5.0; 10 🔵 → 9.0. Mediums bite; pure cosmetic noise stays healthy.

**Cross-axis aggregates** (in the Summary section):
- **Overall Score** = mean of per-axis scores across reviewed axes, rounded to one decimal.
- **Weakest Axis** = the axis with the lowest score, named explicitly. Prevents a single bad axis from hiding behind averaging.

The score is a pure function of the finding counts produced under the Severity
Standard. Do not adjust by feel. If a score looks wrong, the fix is to
re-examine severity tags against the anchor table — not to nudge the number.

## Change Classification

For any **non-`all`** scope (a specific diff: `pr:<N>`, `branch`, `local`,
`staged`, `unpushed`), classify the *nature of the change* — independent of how
many findings it has — as exactly one of:

- **trivial** — no logic touched; reviewing it is a formality. Examples: pure
  renames/moves; formatting- or whitespace-only edits; dependency / lockfile
  bumps; docs, comments, or metadata; config / env-var / CSV / data-row
  additions that don't alter a code path.
- **simple** — straightforward to verify, **regardless of size**: a reviewer can
  confirm correctness at a glance even when the diff is sizable (tens of lines,
  ~50+ is fine). It touches logic, but there's no design decision and no subtle
  correctness reasoning. Size is not the criterion — straightforwardness is.
  Examples: adding `encoding="utf-8"` across many IO calls; mechanically
  plumbing an existing value through call sites; a guard or default whose effect
  is self-evident; a localized, obviously-correct refactor.
- **complex** — anything else: introduces or changes control flow, algorithms,
  data structures, error handling, concurrency, public API / schema semantics,
  or security-sensitive code — i.e. correctness requires reasoning. **When
  uncertain, choose `complex`.**

This verdict is consumed by automation (auto-approval gating), so it must be
machine-parseable. Emit it **verbatim** as a line of the form:

```
**Change class:** <trivial|simple|complex> — <one-line reason>
```

in both `00-summary.md` and `99-pr-comment.md`. The class reflects the change's
*nature*, not its findings — a `simple` change can still carry 🟡/🔵 findings,
and a clean review of a behavioral refactor is still `complex`. For `all`
scope (whole-codebase review) there is no single change under review — omit the
line entirely.

## Critical Axes

Review the codebase across these **8 critical axes**, producing a structured report with findings, severity, and actionable recommendations for each. The axis number ↔ name ↔ output-file-slug spine is canonicalized in `.claude/shared/axes.md`; the per-axis review criteria, severity anchors, and starting points below are the rich, command-local material (not duplicated there).

### Axis 1: Code Quality & Style
- Run `uv run ruff check src/coder_eval/` and `uv run ruff format --check src/coder_eval/`
- Look for: dead code, unused imports, overly complex functions, naming inconsistencies
- Check cyclomatic complexity of key modules (orchestrator, checker, agent)

### Axis 2: Type Safety
- Run `uv run pyright`
- Look for: missing type annotations on public APIs, `Any` escape hatches, inconsistent return types
- Check that Pydantic models have proper field types and validators

### Axis 3: Test Health
- Run `uv run pytest --co -q` to list all tests, then `uv run pytest --tb=short -q` for results
- Evaluate: coverage gaps, test isolation, missing edge cases, flaky test patterns
- Identify untested public APIs or critical paths (orchestrator loop, error handling, criteria checkers)

### Axis 4: Security
- Run `uv run bandit -r src/coder_eval/ -ll` for security scanning
- Run `uv run pip-audit` for dependency vulnerabilities
- Look for: command injection in sandbox/subprocess calls, path traversal, secrets in code, unsafe deserialization

### Axis 5: Architecture & Design
- Evaluate separation of concerns, coupling between modules, cohesion within modules
- Check for: circular imports, god classes, leaky abstractions, violated design patterns from CLAUDE.md
- Assess plugin system extensibility (criteria registry, agent ABC)
- Review the models/ package for DRY violations and schema consistency

### Axis 6: Error Handling & Resilience
- Review the errors/ package for completeness and consistency
- Check for: bare excepts, swallowed exceptions, missing error context, retry logic correctness
- Evaluate graceful degradation in orchestrator, sandbox cleanup, agent lifecycle
- Look for resource leaks (file handles, subprocesses, temp directories)

### Axis 7: API Surface & Maintainability
- Review public APIs for clarity, consistency, and documentation
- Check CLI commands for user-facing correctness (help text, error messages, defaults)
- Evaluate configuration surface (too many knobs? unclear defaults?)
- Look for breaking-change risks or technical debt

### Axis 8: Evaluation Harness Quality
- **Ease of use**: How easy is it to define a new task, run an evaluation, and interpret results? Is the YAML schema intuitive? Are error messages helpful when a task definition is malformed?
- **Task applicability**: Do the 10 success criteria cover real-world coding agent scenarios? Are there gaps (e.g., multi-file changes, refactoring quality, performance benchmarks)? Is the weighting/threshold system flexible enough?
- **Reproducibility**: Can the same task produce consistent results across runs? Evaluate sandbox isolation, snapshot reliability, deterministic scoring, and seed/config pinning
- **Agent extensibility**: How easy is it to add a new agent beyond Claude Code? Is the Agent ABC practical or over-constrained? Does the orchestrator make assumptions tied to a specific agent?
- **Evaluation fairness**: Are criteria well-defined enough to avoid ambiguous pass/fail? Is the llm_judge prompt robust or susceptible to drift?
- **Benchmarking utility**: Can results be meaningfully compared across agents, models, or runs? Are reports structured for aggregation and trend analysis?

## Output Format

This is the shape every sub-agent returns and the shape the final report
takes. Defining it before the Procedure so step 5 has something concrete to
point at.

**Per-axis section** (one per reviewed axis):

```
### Axis N: <Name>
**Score**: N.N / 10
**Counts**: 🔴 N · 🟠 N · 🟡 N · 🔵 N

**Automated Results**: <tool output summary>

**Findings**:
1. [severity: 🔴 Critical | 🟠 High | 🟡 Medium | 🔵 Low] Finding description
   - File(s): path:line
   - Recommendation: what to do (or `open question`)
   - (When applicable) Cross-axis: flagged by axes <comma list>
   - (Axis 4 only) CVSS vector: e.g. `CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H`
```

The Score line is computed from Counts via the Scoring formula — do not write
in a value that doesn't match the formula.

**Summary block** (appended once, at the end of the assembled report):

```
## Summary
| Axis | Score | 🔴 | 🟠 | 🟡 | 🔵 | Top Issue |
|------|-------|----|----|----|----|-----------|
| ...  | ../10 | .. | .. | .. | .. | ...       |

**Overall Score**: N.N / 10 (mean of reviewed axes)
**Weakest Axis**: <Name> at N.N / 10
**Totals**: 🔴 N · 🟠 N · 🟡 N · 🔵 N across all reviewed axes.

**Top 5 Priority Actions**:
1. ...
2. ...
3. ...
4. ...
5. ...
```

## Procedure

1. **Resolve scope and capture review metadata**: Parse `$ARGUMENTS` per the
   Scope Selection rules. Produce:
   - **In-scope file list**: paths the findings will be filed against.
   - **Selected axes**: from `axis:<list>` if present, else all 8.
   - **Action flags**: detect `--post-comment`. When present, resolve the target PR number now (before any expensive work):
     - If scope is `pr:<N>`, target is N.
     - Otherwise, run `gh pr view --json number,title,author,headRefName,baseRefName,state` against the current branch. If it returns an open PR, target is that PR's `number`. If `gh pr view` errors (no PR for the branch) or the PR is `CLOSED`/`MERGED`, abort with a clear error: `--post-comment requires either pr:<N> scope or an open PR for the current branch; got <branch> with no open PR — push the branch and open a PR, or invoke with pr:<N> explicitly.` Do **not** run any tools or sub-agents before this check passes.
     - Stash the resolved PR number and the `gh pr view` metadata blob alongside the rest of step-1 metadata.
   - **Scope summary string**: e.g. `pr:253 (12 files) axis:1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8`.
   - **Reproducibility metadata**: `git rev-parse HEAD` (SHA), `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD` (branch), current ISO timestamp, model identifier (the model running this command). For `pr:<N>` scope additionally capture `gh pr view <N> --json title,author,headRefName,baseRefName,state` so the PR comment header can name the PR. If `--post-comment` resolved a current-branch PR in the previous bullet, reuse that metadata (don't re-fetch). Stash all of this for the summary and PR-comment files.

2. **Prepare the checkout for automated checks**: The automated tools must run against the *exact* state being reviewed, otherwise their output (especially pyright/bandit) is misleading.

   - **`pr:<N>` scope** (or non-PR scope with `--post-comment` that resolved to a current-branch PR whose HEAD differs from the working tree): create a worktree at PR HEAD and install dev deps. Concretely:
     ```
     git worktree add /tmp/pr-<N>-worktree pr-<N>
     (cd /tmp/pr-<N>-worktree && uv sync --extra dev)
     ```
     The `uv sync --extra dev` step is required — without it `pyright`/`bandit`/`pip-audit` are not on PATH inside `uv run`. Stash the worktree path; all automated tools run inside it.
   - **Non-PR scopes** (`all`, `branch`, `local`, `staged`, `unpushed` without `--post-comment`-resolved PR): run automated tools against the working tree at the repo root. No worktree needed; assume dev deps are already installed (the user runs `make verify` locally).

   Stash the resolved "run-tools-here" path for step 2b.

2b. **Automated checks**: Run the automated tools (ruff, pyright, pytest, bandit, pip-audit) in parallel inside the path resolved in step 2, AND pull the repo's CodeQL / code-scanning alerts (below). Tools always scan the full tree; sub-agents are responsible for restricting findings to in-scope files. Notes:
   - `pytest` configuration includes `-n auto` (xdist). If `pytest-xdist` is missing, fall back to `uv run pytest -p no:xdist --tb=line -q`.
   - For `pr:<N>` scope, sub-agents in step 4 are told to read file contents via `git show pr-<N>:<path>` from the *main* repo (not the worktree) — the worktree exists only so that the automated tools see the PR state. Sub-agent Read calls into the worktree path are also acceptable (same contents).
   - **CodeQL / code-scanning alerts** (load-bearing — CodeQL repeatedly catches defects ruff/pyright/bandit miss in this repo: clear-text logging of secrets/tokens, cyclic imports, `return` in `finally`, empty `except: pass`, tautological test assertions). Pull open alerts and bucket them by file:
     ```
     gh api repos/limike954/agent-trajectory-data-00037/code-scanning/alerts -X GET -f state=open --paginate \
       --jq '.[] | {rule:.rule.id, sev:(.rule.security_severity_level // .rule.severity), path:.most_recent_instance.location.path, line:.most_recent_instance.location.start_line, msg:.most_recent_instance.message.text}'
     ```
     For non-`all` scopes, keep only alerts whose `path` is in the in-scope file list (filter by path against the diff). Route each to the right Agent in step 4 — secret-logging → Agent 4; control-flow / error alerts (return-in-finally, empty-except, mixed returns) → Agent 6; import-cycle / dual-import → Agent 5; test-tautology → Agent 3 — and treat an **open** alert on an in-scope line as a confirmed finding at (at least) its CodeQL severity, not a maybe. If the API returns 403 / empty (CodeQL not enabled or token lacks scope), say so in the Automated Results line and lean on the grep-shaped checks in the axis starting points and Techniques block instead.

3. **Discover packages once**: Run `ls src/coder_eval/` to enumerate top-level packages (and `ls tests/` if Axis 3 is in scope). Stash this list — it goes into every sub-agent prompt in step 4. Doing this here, in the main agent, avoids 8× duplicated `ls` work and ensures every sub-agent sees the same authoritative package list (so a new package like `simulation/` or `streaming/` can't be invisible to one axis but not another).

4. **Parallel sub-agent reviews**: Launch one `Agent` sub-agent per *selected* axis (up to 8) in parallel.

   **Each sub-agent prompt MUST include verbatim**:
   - The full **Review Principles** section.
   - The full **Severity Standard** section, including the per-axis anchor table. Pass the whole table — not just the agent's row — so it can calibrate against neighboring axes.
   - The full **Output Format** axis template (above), as the required return shape.
   - The **Scope Selection** scope spec, the in-scope file list, and the two non-`all` rules (read freely, file findings only inside scope). For `pr:<N>` scope, include the rule that file contents come from `git show pr-<N>:<path>`, not the working tree.
   - The package list discovered in step 3.
   - The relevant automated tool output for this axis (e.g. pyright to Agent 2; bandit + pip-audit to Agent 4).
   - The axis-specific starting point below.
   - The full **Techniques to apply** block below — paste it verbatim into each sub-agent prompt. These are concrete bug-shape checks that catch defects a "read the diff and look for issues" pass misses; the block names the five patterns most relevant to a coder_eval change.

   **Techniques to apply** (paste verbatim into every sub-agent prompt):

   ```
   ## Techniques to apply

   In addition to reading the in-scope files end-to-end, run these checks. They catch defect classes that "read the diff and look for problems" misses, and they're cheap because they're grep-shaped.

   1. **Grep for the old pattern on any rename or removal.**
      If the change renames a symbol, file, field, or YAML key — OR removes one — search `src/` and `tests/` for the old name and flag any usage that wasn't updated. Examples: a Pydantic field renamed in `models/sandbox.py` but still referenced by string key in `reports*.py`; a function removed from `orchestrator.py` but still imported in `agents/`; a CLI flag renamed but the old name still appears in `docs/` or task YAMLs. Use `grep -rn` from the repo root, scoped to `src/coder_eval/ tests/ docs/ tasks/` as appropriate. Even a "trivial" rename routinely leaves 1–2 stragglers, so this is the highest-yield single check.

   2. **Compare parallel models / parallel code paths.**
      coder_eval has several pairs of structures that *must* stay in sync. When one is changed, check the other:
        - Models with the same field across types (e.g. `RunSummary` and `VariantAggregate`, `TaskDefinition` and `ResolvedTask`, `EvaluationResult` and the per-row `CriterionResult`): verify type, default, validator, and field description match.
        - Parallel orchestration code paths: `orchestration/batch.py` ↔ `orchestration/experiment.py`. A bug fixed in one routinely needs to be fixed in the other (precedent in this codebase: dataset fan-out, run_limits merging, lineage tracking).
        - Parallel agent paths: `Orchestrator` ↔ any new driver (e.g. `isolation/docker_runner.py`) — does the driver preserve the `pending_turn` / `crashed=True TurnRecord` contract documented in CLAUDE.md?
        - Parallel renderers: `reports.py` ↔ `reports_experiment.py` ↔ `reports_html.py` ↔ `reports_stats.py` — if a new field is added to `EvaluationResult`, do all four render it (and if not, is that deliberate)?
      Flag any divergence as a finding even if the unchanged side is technically still correct in isolation — the divergence itself is the bug, and silent drift between parallel paths is one of the most expensive defects to debug later.

   3. **Check exhaustiveness when an enum / Literal / status set changes.**
      When the change adds, renames, or removes a value of a discriminated union, `Literal`, `StrEnum`, or any closed set (`AgentKind`, `AgentState`, `FinalStatus`, `SnapshotMode`, `ApiBackend`, `SuccessCriterion` discriminator, criterion `type` keys, `ErrorCategory`, etc.), verify that **every** consumer handles the new universe:
        - `dict` lookups keyed on the enum value — does the dict have an entry for the new value, or does it fall through to a generic default like `"?"` or `"unknown"`?
        - `if`/`elif` and `match` chains — is there a final `else` that silently swallows the new value, or does it raise / log?
        - Display / icon / classification mappings in `reports*.py` — does the new value have an icon, a label, a colour, a column?
        - Counting / classification formulas — if a new `FinalStatus.X` is added, do all places computing `pass_rate`/`failure_rate`/`category == "failed"` correctly classify it?
        - JSON Schema / JSON discriminator: if a new criterion type is added, is its model included in the `SuccessCriterion` union *and* re-exported from `coder_eval.models`?
      Fallthrough to a generic default isn't always wrong, but it should be a deliberate choice — flag it so the reviewer can confirm.

   4. **Trace special-char identifiers into path / route / name contexts.**
      Identifiers like `task_id` and `run_id` can contain `/` and other path-special characters — dataset rows are `suite_id/row_id`. When the change introduces or consumes such an id, grep every place it becomes a filesystem path, a filename, a `mkdtemp` / `NamedTemporaryFile` prefix, a URL route segment, a container name, or a cache key, and verify it is sanitized or encoded for that context — including the staging/temp-dir prefix, every route segment, and any place the id is split or joined on a delimiter. An id that works for flat ids silently breaks the moment a dataset-row id (which embeds a `/`) flows through the same path.

   5. **Check the inverse of every new conditional guard / validator.**
      When the change adds a rule of the form "if X then Y must be set / allowed", the inverse — "if not X then Y must be absent / rejected" — is usually also required, and is the half that gets forgotten. Example: a validator that requires an agentless task to skip the agent, but doesn't reject the now-meaningless fields (`simulation` / `initial_prompt`) on that same task — so a contradictory config is silently accepted. For each new guard, state explicitly whether the opposite branch needs an equal-and-opposite check; flag it if the change only does one side.

   6. **Verify conformance to extension-point contracts (agents, criteria, backends, drivers, renderers).**
      coder_eval is a plugin-based, agnostic, multi-agent core (Claude / Codex / NoOp agents via the BYOA SPI; auto-discovered criteria; Bedrock / Anthropic backends; in-process / docker drivers). For every registered member of one of these extension points, confirm it honors the documented contract — a member that *registers* but silently *violates* the contract is a high-severity defect that a "read the code" pass misses because the code looks locally fine.
        - **Agents** (every `Agent` subclass in `agents/`): `communicate()` calls `self._begin_turn()` at the top and `self._end_turn_ok()` on the success path; `stop()` calls `self._mark_stopped()`; it does NOT override `discard_pending_turn()` / `get_state()`. It emits one `AgentStartEvent` at the top and a matching `AgentEndEvent` on EVERY exit path (success / crash / timeout — from a `finally`), with `TurnStart`/`TurnEnd` per turn and `ToolStart`/`ToolEnd` per tool (orphaned tools closed `status=unresolved`). Before any mid-turn `raise AgentCrashError` / `TurnTimeoutError`, `self.pending_turn` is set to a `crashed=True` `TurnRecord`. The returned `TurnRecord` is built ONLY by the internal `EventCollector` — flag any `TurnRecord(` hand-assembled outside the synthetic-crash path. If the agent shells out / holds OS resources, `stop()` / `kill()` / `kill_sync()` are real, and `kill_sync()` is synchronous (no `await` — it runs on the watchdog's non-asyncio thread). It registers via `registry.register("kind", Config)(Agent)` in a `register(registry)` hook on a `coder_eval.plugins` entry point with its own `type: Literal["kind"]` config — and it does NOT wire itself in by editing the `AgentKind` enum or `Orchestrator._create_agent` (which delegates to the registry's `create_agent()` factory); registration is via the SPI hook only.
        - **Per-agent coverage when a new agent is added:** `Settings.validate_api_keys` has a branch for it (don't let it fall through silently — a recurring gap); it supports the run's backends (Bedrock / Anthropic / Azure-OpenAI) or fails with a clear error; it surfaces per-turn `total_cost_usd` so the `max_usd` budget gate can fire; and the token-bucket reconciliation invariant (Σ buckets across `TurnRecord.messages` == `token_usage`) holds, with a test. Agnostic-core litmus: `grep -ri <agent-name> src/coder_eval/` outside the agent's own package + the registry should be ~zero.
        - **Criteria** (every file in `criteria/`): carries `@register_criterion`, implements `_check_impl`, exposes `aggregate()`, is a member of the `SuccessCriterion` union, AND is re-exported from `coder_eval.models`.
        - **Backends / drivers / renderers:** every `ApiBackend` is handled in judge routing + pricing + `validate_api_keys`; every sandbox driver / preservation mode preserves the stale-artifact-clear, synthetic-`task.json`-on-death, and env-scrub contracts; every `reports*.py` renderer covers each `EvaluationResult` field / `FinalStatus`.
      Several of these are statically enforceable — when you find a violation whose shape is grep-/AST-detectable (an `Agent` subclass missing `_begin_turn`, a bare `raise AgentCrashError` with no preceding `self.pending_turn =`, an `async def kill_sync`, a `TurnRecord(` built outside `EventCollector`, a criterion missing from the `SuccessCriterion` union), propose it as a `CEnnn` lint rule in the Harness & Lint pass.

   Apply these techniques while reading. Findings produced this way go into the same output as ordinary findings, tagged with the appropriate axis and severity.
   ```

   **Each sub-agent returns** its axis section in the exact **per-axis Output Format defined above** — `### Axis N: <Name>` heading, Score line, Counts line, Automated Results line, Findings list — as raw markdown. The main agent concatenates these sections into the report with minimal reshuffling; sub-agents that return a different shape force the main agent to reformat, wasting tokens and risking drift.

   **Axis starting points** — these are *entry points, not exhaustive lists*. Sub-agents follow imports and reconcile against the package list from step 3 so newly added top-level packages aren't invisible.

   - **Agent 1 — Code Quality & Style**: Start at `orchestrator.py`, `sandbox.py`, `agent.py`, `evaluation/checker.py`. Cross-reference with ruff output. Actively file **over-engineering** findings (not just style): when the change adds machinery that exceeds what the goal needs — a new enum/flag/alias layer for state that's already derivable, a hardcoded list of magic-string special-cases where a generic mechanism fits, or an abstraction for a single call site — file it per the Axis 1 anchors. Senior reviewers block on this repeatedly — e.g. an enum/flag/alias layer for a lever already derivable from existing state; a boolean flag where a Null-Object implementation would be simpler; hardcoded magic-string special-cases (`FLOW_V2_*`-style constants) where a generic mechanism fits — a review that calls such a change "clean" is a miss.
   - **Agent 2 — Type Safety**: Start at the same hot modules and `models/`. Cross-reference with pyright output.
   - **Agent 3 — Test Health**: Start at `tests/`. Cross-reference with pytest output. The single most frequent miss in this repo is **new public behavior shipped untested** — it is the most common reviewer block. For every new public function, CLI command, validator branch, scoring gate, and report row, require a direct assertion on the *new contract*, not just an exit-code smoke test. Two shapes recur and must be checked explicitly: (a) **the gate that turns a gap into a score** — a `min_prompts` / threshold / pass-gate is tested only on the happy path, so the branch that actually changes the score is never exercised; require a test that trips the gate; (b) **event-reassembled records** — when a persisted record (e.g. `task.json`) is rebuilt field-by-field from the event stream, a future unmirrored field drops silently with no failing assertion; require a full-field parity test (assert over `model_fields`, not a hand-picked subset).
   - **Agent 4 — Security**: Start at `sandbox.py`, `agents/`, `evaluation/`, and any subprocess/command execution code. Cross-reference with bandit and pip-audit output. Also grep for secrets reaching a log/print sink — `grep -rnE '(log|logger|logging|print|console)[^\n]*(token|secret|password|passwd|api[_-]?key|bearer|credential)' src/` — any token/secret/password value written to a logger or printed is clear-text-secret-logging (CodeQL's single most frequent hit in this repo; bandit does NOT catch it). File it 🟠+ at the sink line. Fold in any routed CodeQL security alerts as confirmed findings.
   - **Agent 5 — Architecture & Design**: Start at `models/`, `criteria/`, `orchestrator.py`, `agent.py`, `agents/`. Then walk the rest of `src/coder_eval/`. Two extra checks: (a) **default vs. documented convention** — does a new default contradict a convention stated in `CLAUDE.md` (e.g. agnostic-core with UiPath opt-in)? A base-image / extras default shipped the wrong way round (proprietary-by-default instead of opt-in) is a recurring miss. (b) **internal coupling in a going-public core** — `coder-eval` is being made OSS-public, so flag any change that couples the importable core to an internal-only system (dashboard / ADO / Athena / the UiPath SDK / an internal secret store) instead of keeping it strippable behind an extra or a separate package. A useful litmus: a `grep -ri <internal-system> src/coder_eval/` should return zero hits in the core package; the generic 90% of such a feature belongs in vendor-neutral core, the proprietary 10% belongs behind an extra or out of the wheel entirely. (c) **extension-point conformance** — apply Technique 6's registry/SPI checks to the agent / criteria / backend / driver / renderer registries: a member that *registers* but silently *violates* its contract (an `Agent` subclass that skips the lifecycle hooks or the `crashed=True` partial-turn contract; a criterion missing from the `SuccessCriterion` union; an `ApiBackend` not handled in every consumer) is an architecture defect even though each file reads fine locally.
   - **Agent 6 — Error Handling & Resilience**: Start at `errors/`, `orchestrator.py`, `sandbox.py`, `agents/`. Specifically grep for three high-recurrence bug shapes CodeQL keeps finding here: `return` / `break` / `continue` inside a `finally` block (silently swallows any in-flight exception); `except ...: pass` (or `except Exception:`) with no explanatory comment; and functions mixing implicit (`return` / fall-through `None`) with explicit returns. Also decide, per path, **fail loud vs degrade gracefully** — getting this backwards recurs as a blocker: a blanket `except` that swallows a *first-party or required* failure (the same handler meant for optional third-party plugins) hides real breakage — e.g. a built-in plugin/registration failure silently swallowed, or a null *required* secret swallowed instead of aborting; first-party/required failures must be loud. Conversely, an artifact the harness must *always* produce (a report exporter, a synthetic ERROR `task.json` on abnormal exit) must degrade rather than crash on malformed input or an unknown status — and never let the diagnostic path mask the original error. Fold in any routed CodeQL control-flow/error alerts as confirmed findings.
   - **Agent 7 — API Surface & Maintainability**: Start at `cli/`, `config.py`, and public module APIs.
   - **Agent 8 — Evaluation Harness Quality**: Start at `orchestrator.py`, `sandbox.py`, `evaluation/`, `criteria/`, `models/tasks.py`, `models/criteria.py`, task YAMLs in `tasks/`, and `docs/TASK_DEFINITION_GUIDE.md`. Always assess **daily/nightly blast radius**: trace whether the change touches the production run path — the cron/nightly entrypoint, the `DockerRunner` container entrypoint, or the `--backend bedrock` judge route — and state the impact explicitly, including whether a container image or persisted schema must be rebuilt in lockstep (a wire-format or schema change that isn't rebuilt breaks the nightly under version skew). **The nightly pipeline and its dashboard/reporting now live in a separate repo (`coder-eval-uipath` / eval-runner), so a contract change here can break a consumer this repo no longer contains — call that out explicitly** (the run-record/`task.json` schema, report JSON shape, and CLI output are the cross-repo contract surface). The team gates merges on this — review threads regularly lead with a daily-run trace; "does this break the nightly?" is a required answer, not an optional one. For any agent change, also apply Technique 6's **agent-conformance** checks (lifecycle hooks, `AgentEndEvent` on every exit path, the `crashed=True` partial-turn contract, `EventCollector`-only `TurnRecord`, and `validate_api_keys` + backend + per-turn-cost coverage) — agent extensibility is only real if every agent honors the contract the orchestrator assumes.

5. **Synthesize results**: Assemble the report in the **Output Format defined above** by concatenating each sub-agent's axis section, then writing the Summary block:
   - **Recompute every axis score from its `Counts` line using the published formula** (the per-axis formula in the **## Scoring** section above, rounded to one decimal). If a sub-agent's reported score doesn't match, replace it with the formula result — sub-agent arithmetic is unreliable (observed in practice: agents off by 0.1–0.5 on multiple axes in a single run). The Counts are the source of truth; the Score is a pure function of them. Do the same for the Overall Score (mean across axes) and Weakest Axis after the per-axis fixups.
   - Deduplicate findings: if the same `file:line` appears in two sub-agents' outputs with the same root cause, merge them into one entry. **Re-decrement the Counts and re-run the score formula** on the affected axis after a merge — a finding folded into another shouldn't keep contributing to the count. This includes **semantic** duplicates that aren't at the same `file:line` (e.g. the same root cause surfaced under two different axes); merge those too and keep it under the single most-relevant axis.
   - **Theme-group same-class findings before scoring.** When N findings are instances of one mechanical theme (e.g. several god-functions / radon-F functions; several instances of one stringly-typed-dict pattern), collapse them into ONE scored finding that **enumerates its members** (list each file:line in the recommendation), scored **once** at the cluster's highest severity. Do not let one theme tank an axis by counting N times — e.g. four separate "god-function" 🟠s scoring an axis at 4.4 is a scoring artifact, not a 4.4-quality axis. Be conservative: only group genuinely same-class items; distinct bugs stay separate and count individually.
   - When two or more axes flag the same `file:line` (different lenses converging on one location), add a `Cross-axis: flagged by axes <list>` note to the merged finding. This is a stronger signal than any single axis — a systemic issue visible through multiple lenses. Do not use a "confirmed by N/8" framing: sub-agents are siloed per axis, so "confirmation" isn't what's happening; cross-axis convergence is.
   - Only discard a finding if it recommends adding speculative complexity *with no concrete bug behind it*. A real bug stays even if the recommended fix is debatable — record the bug, mark the recommendation as `open question`.
   - On severity disagreement for the same finding, apply the Severity Standard rule: take the highest rating, note the disagreement.
   - **Derive the "What's Missing" list**: after assembling the per-axis findings, do a dedicated synthesis pass that asks *what should have been changed but wasn't?* This is orthogonal to the 8 axes — diff-only reviews routinely miss it. Walk the merged findings and the in-scope file list and call out items in these five buckets:
     - **Parallel code paths not updated**: e.g. `orchestration/batch.py` was changed but `orchestration/experiment.py` wasn't, despite handling the same concept; a fix landed in `Orchestrator` but the parallel `DockerRunner` path was missed.
     - **Missing tests for new code paths**: every new branch, public function, validator, CLI flag, and report row needs a test. If a report row was added, is there a test asserting non-zero values for it?
     - **Downstream consumers of changed counting / classification / formula logic**: if a counting formula changed in one place, did all places that compute rates / averages / percentages / pass/fail status from those counts also update? Same for any threshold or scoring change.
     - **Display / icon / mapping dicts not extended for new enum values**: if a new `FinalStatus` / `AgentState` / `SnapshotMode` / criterion type / category was added, do all rendering dicts in `reports*.py` (`reports.py` / `reports_experiment.py` / `reports_html.py` / `reports_stats.py`) cover it, or do they fall through to `"?"` / `"unknown"`?
     - **Daily/nightly pipeline impact not stated**: if the change touches the production run path (the cron/nightly entrypoint, the `DockerRunner` entrypoint, the `--backend bedrock` judge) or the cross-repo contract consumed by the external `coder-eval-uipath` / eval-runner pipeline (run-record / `task.json` schema, report JSON shape, CLI output), does the PR say what happens to the nightly run? An unstated blast radius on the daily pipeline is itself the gap.

     This pass is allowed to surface items that are not tied to a single file:line (since the whole point is that the *absence* of a change isn't anchored anywhere). Express each as a short bullet, prefixed with the bucket it falls into, and reference the *changed* file that triggered the expectation. Each bullet should also carry a severity tag (🔴 / 🟠 / 🟡 / 🔵) using the same anchor table — a missing test for a new public function is 🟠 Test Health; a missing entry in a display dict is typically 🟡; a missing parallel-path update that introduces a real divergence is 🟠 Architecture. **Add these severity tags to the per-axis totals** so they show up in Counts and on-screen output. If there's nothing missing, write a single line: "Nothing identified."

   - **Derive "Harness & Lint Improvements"**: after the findings are settled, do one more synthesis pass that asks *what would stop this whole class of finding from recurring?* — independent of the per-finding fixes. This is the CLAUDE.md standing rule ("when fixing a bug, ask: could a custom lint rule have prevented this?") applied to the review as a whole; the team institutionalizes review catches as custom lint rules (the `CE001`–`CEnnn` series in `tests/lint/rules/`, wired up in `tests/lint/runner.py`), so a review that finds a mechanically-detectable defect and *doesn't* propose the rule is leaving the highest-leverage fix on the table.

     **Static-check-first.** For *every* finding (not just 🟠+), the first question is: *can a static check catch this — and if not, why not?* The goal is to push as many defect classes as possible left into a mechanical gate that fails in `make verify` / CI before a human ever reviews, rather than relying on the next reviewer to remember the pattern. Prefer, in order: (1) a `ruff` rule or config already available; (2) a `pyright` tightening (stricter types, a `Literal`/enum instead of `str`, `@override`); (3) a custom `CEnnn` lint rule in `tests/lint/rules/`; (4) `bandit` / `pip-audit` / CodeQL coverage for the security shapes. Only when a defect is genuinely *not* statically detectable (it needs runtime state, network, or semantic judgment) does it fall back to a test or a process note — and say so explicitly, so the boundary of what static analysis can reach is a deliberate, recorded decision, not an omission. Produce two buckets:
     - **Static checks (lint / type)**: for any finding whose root cause is grep- or AST-detectable (a missing kwarg like `limit=` on `create_subprocess_*`, an import-direction / layering violation, `type(x).__name__` string dispatch, a positional `list[i] ⟷ list[i]` coupling, a denylist membership test against a closed enum, `assert` on externally-influenced state, a free `str` where a `FinalStatus`/`Literal` belongs, a missing return type on a hot-module public fn), propose the concrete enforcement: a new `CEnnn` rule (one-line statement of the pattern it forbids, the file(s) it would have caught, where it slots into `tests/lint/rules/` + `tests/lint/runner.py`, using the next free CE number), or the exact `ruff`/`pyright` setting to flip. State which existing findings each check would have caught.
     - **Harness improvements**: gaps the review exposed in the eval harness or dev workflow that a static check *cannot* reach — a missing parity/golden test that would have caught an event-reassembled `task.json` drift; a missing `make` target or CI check; a reproducibility guard (seed pinning, sandbox-isolation default, shared-state reset between tasks); a scoring-determinism assertion. For each, note briefly why it can't be a pure static check (e.g. "needs a live event stream to diff"). Each as a short bullet with the finding(s) that motivate it.

     Tie each suggestion back to the finding(s) it would prevent. If nothing is mechanically preventable, write "Nothing identified." — do not invent speculative rules.

6. **Write report files** (to disk — the report itself was assembled in step 5): Generate a timestamped output directory so successive reviews don't overwrite each other:

   - Run `date +%y%m%d-%H%M` to get the current timestamp (e.g. `260513-1742`).
   - Create `tmp/code-review-<timestamp>/` (e.g. `tmp/code-review-260513-1742/`).
   - Write the following files into that directory (referred to below as `<dir>`):

   - `<dir>/00-summary.md` — must start with a **Review Metadata** block (from step 1's stash) so reviews are comparable across runs:
     ```
     ## Review Metadata
     - Timestamp: <ISO timestamp>
     - Git SHA: <full SHA>
     - Branch: <branch>
     - Scope: <scope spec, e.g. `pr:253` or `branch` or `all`>
     - In-scope files: <count> (full list in body if non-`all`)
     - Axes reviewed: <comma list>
     - Model: <model identifier running this command>
     - Change class: <trivial|simple|complex> — <one-line reason> (omit for `all` scope)
     ```
     Then: Summary table, Critical & High Issues section (🔴/🟠 only, sorted by severity then axis; security findings include CVSS vector), **What's Missing** section (the synthesis-pass output from step 5, grouped by bucket; or "Nothing identified."), **Harness & Lint Improvements** section (the synthesis-pass output from step 5, split into the two buckets — *Static checks (lint / type)* and *Harness improvements* — each suggestion tied to the finding(s) it prevents; or "Nothing identified."), Top 5 Priority Actions.
   - `<dir>/<slug>.md` — one full per-axis report per reviewed axis, named by the **Slug** column of the axis catalog in `.claude/shared/axes.md` (e.g. `01-code-quality.md`, `04-security.md`, … `08-harness-quality.md`). Omit any axis not in scope.

   After writing, print the resolved `<dir>` path so the user can find the report.

7. **Print the executive summary to the screen**: Files are easy to miss in a long terminal. Emit the executive summary inline as your final user-facing message so the user can read the verdict without opening anything. This is **in addition to** the files, not a replacement — keep the files complete.

   The on-screen summary MUST include, in this order:
   - One-sentence verdict (e.g. "Solid feature work, but blocked on test coverage and one Linux-only privilege escalation.").
   - The **Change class** line (`trivial` / `simple` / `complex`) for non-`all` scopes — same verbatim form as the files.
   - The Summary table (axes × scores × counts × top issue) — same shape as `00-summary.md`.
   - `Overall Score`, `Weakest Axis`, and the `Totals` line.
   - The full **Critical & High Issues** list (🔴 / 🟠 only) — one line per finding in the form `[Axis N] <description> (file:line)`. Security findings include the CVSS vector.
   - The **What's Missing** list (grouped by bucket: Parallel paths / Tests / Downstream consumers / Display & mapping dicts). Tight one-line bullets. If "Nothing identified.", say that and skip the heading.
   - The **Harness & Lint Improvements** list — one-line bullets, *Static checks (lint / type)* first (the proposed `CEnnn` rule or `ruff`/`pyright` setting + what it would have caught), then *Harness improvements*. If "Nothing identified.", say that and skip the heading.
   - The **Top 5 Priority Actions** in full prose.
   - A trailing `Full report: <dir>` line pointing at the path printed in step 6.

   Do NOT print the 🟡 / 🔵 findings inline — those live in the per-axis files. The on-screen view is the executive summary; the files are the source of truth.

   Cap the on-screen summary at roughly 80 lines. If Critical & High issues exceed ~12, switch to grouped bullets (`[Axes 4, 6] Container/subprocess leak + no wall-clock cap — see 04, 06`) and direct the reader to the files.

8. **Always draft a PR-review-style comment**: Write `<dir>/99-pr-comment.md` regardless of scope. The file structure is identical in every case; only the header framing changes:
   - **`pr:<N>` scope**, OR **`--post-comment` resolved an open PR on the current branch**: header names the PR (title, author, headRef → baseRef, state). This is the author-facing comment.
   - **Other scopes with no PR**: header lists scope/branch/SHA/timestamp. The file is then a review-prep document the user can repurpose into a self-review, a hand-off note, or a draft PR description.

   `99-pr-comment.md` must be detailed enough to stand on its own (the reader should not need to open per-axis files for the headline view), but tighter than 00-summary.md (no per-axis Findings dumps — those stay in `01-*.md` … `08-*.md`). Required sections, in order:

   ```
   # Review: <PR title or scope-appropriate header>

   <Header sub-line: PR #N by @author · <headRef> → <baseRef> · state · reviewed against <short-SHA>
   — for pr:<N> scopes (and for non-PR scopes where --post-comment resolved to the current branch's PR).
   For other scopes: Scope · branch · <short-SHA> · timestamp.
   Keep to one line. The <short-SHA> is the first 7 chars of the SHA reviewed (PR HEAD for PR scopes;
   `git rev-parse HEAD` for non-PR scopes) — pinning the SHA prevents confusion after fixup pushes
   force-update the PR head, and lets a re-review against a later commit cite "previous review
   against <old-SHA>".>

   <2–4 sentence verdict — what's working, what's blocking, what's optional.
   Acknowledge concrete strengths before going into issues; reviewers who
   open with criticism alone read as adversarial. End with the overall
   score and the weakest axis, so the reader knows the bottom line before
   scrolling.>

   ## Summary

   <The same Summary table from 00-summary.md (axis | score | counts | top issue),
   verbatim. Reviewers expect a glanceable table at the top of a long comment.>

   **Overall Score**: N.N / 10 · **Weakest Axis**: <Name> at N.N / 10
   **Totals**: 🔴 N · 🟠 N · 🟡 N · 🔵 N across <axes> reviewed.

   ## Blockers

   <Every 🔴 finding, plus every 🟠 finding except ones that are clearly
   "polish, not pre-merge" (e.g. a missing --help example would be 🟡 not 🟠).
   Each entry: a numbered 2–3 sentence narrative with the file:line, the
   concrete fix, and (for Axis 4) the CVSS vector. Avoid bare bullet lists —
   PR readers skim narratives better than tables. If there are zero blockers,
   write "No blockers found." and move on — don't manufacture one.>

   ## Non-blocking, but please consider before merge

   <All 🟡 findings, plus any 🟠 demoted from Blockers. Group related items
   under short sub-bullets when there are 5+ findings (e.g. all schema/typing
   items together; all docs items together). Each item: one tight sentence
   with file:line and a one-line fix. Be exhaustive — this is the "log of
   things to think about" section.>

   ## Nits

   <Every 🔵 finding worth surfacing. Single-line bullets, file:line, one-line
   fix. Skip findings that recommend speculative complexity without a concrete
   bug — those belong in follow-up issues, not in a PR comment.>

   ## What's Missing

   <The "What's Missing" synthesis-pass output from step 5. Group by bucket:
   **Parallel paths**, **Tests**, **Downstream consumers**, **Display & mapping dicts**.
   Tight one-line bullets, each prefixed with its severity tag and the file
   that triggered the expectation. This section is gold for PR comments —
   it's the kind of "you also need to update X" feedback that authors find
   most actionable. If "Nothing identified.", write that and omit the section
   entirely (don't surface an empty heading).>

   ## Harness & Lint Improvements

   <The "Harness & Lint Improvements" synthesis-pass output from step 5, in two
   sub-groups: **Static checks (lint / type)** — the proposed `CEnnn` rule or
   `ruff`/`pyright` setting, plus the existing finding(s) it would have caught —
   and **Harness improvements** — tests / CI / reproducibility guards a static
   check can't reach. One-line bullets, each tied to the finding(s) it prevents.
   This frames the durable fix, not just the point fix, which authors and
   maintainers value. If "Nothing identified.", write that and omit the section.>

   ## Top 5 Priority Actions

   <The same Top 5 Priority Actions from 00-summary.md, verbatim. Reviewers
   appreciate "if you only do three things, do these" framing at the end of
   a long comment.>

   ---

   **Change class:** <trivial|simple|complex> — <one-line reason>
   <!-- machine-parseable; emit for non-`all` scopes only. See "Change Classification". -->
   **Stats:** N 🔴 · N 🟠 · N 🟡 · N 🔵 across <N> axes reviewed.
   Full per-axis breakdown: `<dir>/01-code-quality.md` … `<dir>/08-harness-quality.md`.
   ```

   Tone rules:
   - **Be constructive, not adversarial.** Lead with what works. Frame findings as "consider X" / "this would benefit from Y" rather than "this is wrong".
   - **Drop the severity emoji and `[severity: 🔴 Critical]` tag.** The section heading (`Blockers` / `Non-blocking` / `Nits`) carries the severity signal in language reviewers expect.
   - **Keep file:line references.** They're the load-bearing detail that makes a comment actionable.
   - **Drop the "Cross-axis: flagged by axes …" notes** — that's review-process language, not author-facing language.
   - **Don't trim findings to fit a length target.** Be exhaustive within the Blockers / Non-blocking / Nits sections; the entry filter is *relevance and actionability*, not word count. If the file ends up longer than 00-summary.md, that's fine.

   After writing the file:
   - Print `PR comment draft: <dir>/99-pr-comment.md` on a dedicated line.
   - **If `--post-comment` was specified**: run `gh pr review <N> --comment --body-file <dir>/99-pr-comment.md` against the PR number resolved in step 1 (either the explicit `pr:<N>` or the current branch's open PR). The user authorized this via the flag; do not re-confirm. On success, print the PR URL returned by `gh`. On failure, print the error and the path so the user can post manually.
   - **Otherwise, no `--post-comment`**:
     - If scope is `pr:<N>`, or the current branch has an open PR (cheap check: `gh pr view --json number,url -q '.number,.url' 2>/dev/null`), suggest `gh pr review <N> --comment --body-file <dir>/99-pr-comment.md` as the one-liner to post once the user is happy with it. Don't run it.
     - Otherwise (no PR exists), no posting suggestion — the file is for the user's own use.

9. **Cleanup**: If step 2 created a worktree (i.e. for `pr:<N>` scope or a `--post-comment`-resolved PR), remove it now:
   ```
   git worktree remove --force /tmp/pr-<N>-worktree
   git branch -D pr-<N>
   ```
   Skip for non-PR scopes (nothing was created). Cleanup happens *after* the report is written and (optionally) posted — never bail out earlier or the worktree leaks across sessions and the next review's `git worktree add` fails with "already exists".
