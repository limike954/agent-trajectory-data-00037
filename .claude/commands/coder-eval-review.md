description: Generate per-task review.json (summary + tags) for a completed run
---

## Context

If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty or blank, default to `runs/latest` and inform the user: "No path provided — reviewing the latest run at `runs/latest`."

You are producing post-run reviews for a coder_eval evaluation run. The target path is: `$ARGUMENTS`

For each **failed task** in the run you write a structured `review.json` next to that task's `task.json`, plus a small `review_index.json` digest at the run root for fast aggregation. Output is JSON only — no narrative.

## Step 1: Load the suggested vocabulary

Read `src/coder_eval/resources/tags.yaml` (relative to the repo root). It has a top-level `tags:` list of `{name, definition, examples}` entries. **Prefer these names** when classifying — but the vocabulary is a suggestion, not a strict allowlist. If nothing fits, emit a kebab-case slug that does. Drift is caught by a lint, not blocked at write time.

If the vocabulary file is missing or unparseable, continue with an empty suggestion list (don't abort) — drift lint will surface every tag you emit.

## Step 2: Discover failed tasks

The run layout (`runs/<run_id>/<variant_id>/<task_id>/<NN>/…`, `<NN>` a zero-padded replicate index) is defined in `.claude/shared/run-layout.md`.

1. Read `<run_path>/run.json` if present (for context — `run_id`, `start_time`).
2. Glob `<run_path>/*/*/*/task.json` and read each one.
3. Read `<run_path>/analysis.md` if present — it already diagnoses many failures; lean on its findings rather than re-deriving them.
4. A task counts as **failed** if `final_status != "SUCCESS"` **or** `weighted_score < 0.9`. Skip passing tasks for now (we may extend to passing tasks later — the schema supports it).

If no `task.json` files exist, write an empty `review_index.json` (`{"reviews": []}`) and exit.

## Step 3: Write per-task review.json

For each failed task, write `<run_path>/<variant_id>/<task_id>/<NN>/review.json` with this exact shape:

```json
{
  "task_id": "skill-flow-ipe-ceql-where",
  "summary": "Validation failed with 'expected string, received undefined' on CeqlWhereTest.flow; 1200s turn_timeout was hit waiting for the connector to activate.",
  "tags": ["validation-error", "infra"],
  "created_at": "2026-05-08T12:00:00Z"
}
```

Field rules:

- **`task_id`** — exact `task_id` from the corresponding `task.json`. **Must equal the parent directory name** — the review validator rejects mismatches because they would silently misattribute reviews. (variant_id and replicate are encoded by the file path; no need to repeat them.)
- **`summary`** — 1-3 sentences of plain prose describing what happened. Cite specific evidence: error string, criterion name, agent behavior, or a quote from `analysis.md`. ≤ 480 chars. This is the human-readable explanation; tags are the machine-readable filter.
- **`tags`** — array of kebab-case strings. ≤ 8 per task. Prefer names from `tags.yaml`; new ones are fine when nothing fits. Each tag must match `^[a-z0-9]+(-[a-z0-9]+)*$`.
- **`created_at`** — ISO 8601 UTC timestamp matching `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS(.fff)?(Z|±HH:MM)` (e.g. `2026-05-08T12:00:00Z`). Bare strings like `"yesterday"` are rejected.

Examples of good reviews:

- `task.json` shows `weighted_score=0.0`, criterion `uipath_eval` failed with `"Schema validation failed: expected string, received undefined"`:
  ```json
  {"task_id":"skill-flow-ipe-ceql-where","summary":"uipath_eval criterion failed: 'Schema validation failed: expected string, received undefined' on CeqlWhereTest.flow.","tags":["validation-error"],"created_at":"..."}
  ```
- Agent ran the same `uip run flow.flow` 7 times with identical error:
  ```json
  {"task_id":"...","summary":"Agent retried 'uip run flow.flow' 7x without adapting after CLI exit code 1.","tags":["agent-loop"],"created_at":"..."}
  ```
- Files look correct but `command_executed` expected `uip publish` while agent used `uipath publish`:
  ```json
  {"task_id":"...","summary":"Agent produced correct outputs; command_executed pattern was too narrow (expected 'uip publish', agent used 'uipath publish').","tags":["criteria-bug"],"created_at":"..."}
  ```

## Step 4: Write the run-level index

After all per-task reviews are written, write `<run_path>/review_index.json`:

```json
{
  "generated_at": "2026-05-08T12:00:00Z",
  "reviews": [
    {
      "task_id": "skill-flow-ipe-ceql-where",
      "variant_id": "default",
      "replicate": "00",
      "tags": ["validation-error", "infra"],
      "summary_excerpt": "uipath_eval criterion failed: 'Schema validation failed: expected string, received undefined'..."
    }
  ]
}
```

- One entry per `(task_id, variant_id, replicate)` triple corresponding to a `review.json` you wrote — the review validator rejects index/file set mismatches.
- `summary_excerpt` (required): first 160 chars of the per-task `summary`, ellipsized if truncated. ≤ 200 chars hard cap.
- The index is a *digest*: it lets the run-grid UI and the cross-run hotspots view aggregate without fetching N per-task files. The per-task `review.json` remains the source of truth.

## Step 5: Report

Print one line:

```
Wrote 7 review.json files + review_index.json to runs/2026-05-08_04-46-07: 4 distinct tag(s)
```

## Principles

- **Per-task review is the source of truth**: the run-level index is a derived digest, not a separate dataset.
- **Vocabulary first, free-form last**: prefer names from `tags.yaml`. Make up new ones only when nothing fits — drift lint will surface them.
- **Evidence in `summary`**: every summary must cite specific failure data — error string, criterion description, observed behavior, quote from `analysis.md`.
- **Skip passing tasks** (for now): keeps the review set focused. The schema can extend to positive reviews later (e.g. `tags: ["optimal-path"]`).
- **Don't validate against the vocabulary**: emit whatever fits. The review tooling and the lint script handle drift.
