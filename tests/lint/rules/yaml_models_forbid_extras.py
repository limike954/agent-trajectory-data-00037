"""CE009: Pydantic input-config models must declare ``extra='forbid'``.

Without ``extra='forbid'`` a misspelled YAML key (e.g. ``directry: foo/`` vs
``directory: foo/`` on ``ReferenceSource``, or a typo on a criterion field) is
silently dropped on the floor — the user gets no signal that the key was
ignored. ``extra='forbid'`` rejects unknown keys at load time, surfacing the
typo with a concrete field name in the error message.

Scope (hard-coded path filter) — every model module that parses user-facing
YAML (task or experiment definitions):
  - ``src/coder_eval/models/tasks.py``
  - ``src/coder_eval/models/criteria.py``
  - ``src/coder_eval/models/mutations.py``
  - ``src/coder_eval/models/experiment.py``
  - ``src/coder_eval/models/templates.py``
  - ``src/coder_eval/models/sandbox.py``
  - ``src/coder_eval/models/agent_config.py``
  - ``src/coder_eval/models/limits.py``

Result/persistence models are EXEMPT — deliberate round-trip leniency:
``models/results.py`` and ``models/telemetry.py`` are out of scope entirely
(they preserve forward-compat fields through ``model_dump_json`` →
``model_validate_json`` round-trips of task.json records), and the
result-shaped classes inside ``models/experiment.py`` (``VariantResult``,
``ExperimentResult``, …) carry per-class ``# noqa: CE009`` suppressions for
the same reason.

A class is considered compliant when ANY of the following holds:
  1. Its own body declares ``model_config = ConfigDict(..., extra='forbid', ...)``.
  2. It inherits from a base defined in the SAME file whose body declares the
     above (pydantic inherits ``model_config`` from the parent).
  3. It does NOT directly extend ``BaseModel`` in its ``bases`` clause — only
     direct ``BaseModel`` subclasses are flagged. A class extending a non-compliant
     same-file base that itself extends ``BaseModel`` slips through this rule;
     compliance is treated as the base's responsibility (and the base is itself
     flagged). This trade keeps the rule cheap to implement without walking the
     transitive base chain across files.

Add ``# noqa: CE009`` on the class statement line for an intentional exception.
