"""CE018: Don't string-membership-test against ``FinalStatus`` member names.

Comparing a status string against a denylist of ``FinalStatus`` member names
(``s == "SUCCESS"``, ``s in ("FAILURE", "TIMEOUT")``) re-implements the
``FinalStatus.category`` classification by hand. The two drift the moment a new
member is added: the denylist silently misses it (the bug ``_status_badge`` had,
where new budget-exceeded statuses fell through to a ``neutral`` badge). The
``category`` property is the single source of truth — classify via
``FinalStatus(s).category`` instead.

Flagged patterns (must reference ≥1 real FinalStatus member name, so unrelated
string comparisons don't trip):

  * ``s == "SUCCESS"`` / ``!=`` / reversed ``"ERROR" == s``
  * ``s in ("FAILURE", "TIMEOUT")`` / ``not in`` against a tuple/list/set of such names

Add ``# noqa: CE018`` on the offending line for the rare legitimate case
(e.g., asserting against a specific member name in a test).
